participant-booking-app
=======================

This app removes some of the headache from human research by automating much of the admin work related to contacting participants, signing up for a slot, sending reminder emails/SMS etc.  Key features include:

* can run your department's 'Participant Credit Scheme'
* schedule testing by specifying slots on a drag and drop calendar.
* 'good' participant and experimenter points for e.g. showing up on time.
* email and SMS reminders.
* Facebook and Twitter integration.
* Reminders to the experimenter to feedback to the participant about overall results at a much later date.
